# About

Arturo is an independently-developed, modern programming language following some very simple and straightforward principles:

* Code is just a list of words, symbols and literal values.
  
* Words and symbols within a block are interpreted - when needed - according to the context.
  
* No reserved words or keywords - look for them as hard as you can; there are absolutely none.
