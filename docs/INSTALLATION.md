# Installation

Please use the `full` binary for your platform from [the official releases page][official-releases].
At the moment, the track targets the Arturo 0.10.0 Arizona Bark release.

~~~~exercism/caution
Homebrew is a popular third-party method of installing software on macOS and Linux platforms.
However, its recipe for Arturo targets the `mini` build which is incompatible with this track.

For further assistance installing Arturo, please consult the [official Arturo Discord][discord].

## Running Arturo code

At that point, you're ready to start writing Arturo code!
To access the Arturo REPL, run `arturo` at the command-line.
